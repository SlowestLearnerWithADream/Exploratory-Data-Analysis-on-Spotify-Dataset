2. Provide summary statistics to give an overview of key metrics such as the number of streams, release dates, and musical attributes (e.g., BPM, danceability).
3. Use appropriate visualizations (e.g., bar charts, histograms, scatter plots) to uncover trends and patterns in the data. Ensure that your plots are well-labeled and easy to interpret.
4. Investigate correlations between different variables and provide insights based on your findings. Explore relationships between streams and other musical characteristics like tempo, energy, or playlists.
5. Based on your analysis, offer any insights or recommendations regarding the tracks, artists, or musical trends that could be useful for understanding what makes a track popular.
